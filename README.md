### Dice!

Dice game which was my first own project in pure JavaScript.

**Game is available only in Polish.**

If you want to know the rules, you can check "Zasady" window (**You have to click "Zasady" button**) in main board screen which open when you start new game and choose:
- number of players
- players names

Good luck and have fun! :)
